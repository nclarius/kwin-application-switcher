Automatically raises all other visible windows of the same application together when activating one of them, effectively creating application groups to task-switch between.

This extension gives rise to an application-centric task switching workflow as known from environments such as GNOME or MacOS, where an application’s windows are treated as a group, and task switching can take place at two levels: one mode for switching applications and one mode for switching between windows of an application. 

Raising all windows collectively whenever the application is entered means that all windows belonging to the application are available at the front, and closing or minimizing a window will keep focus on the same application, as the window switched to will be the most recently active one of that application provided that there is any, rather than the most recently active window overall which may belong to a different application.
